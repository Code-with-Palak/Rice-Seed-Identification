# 🍚 Rice Seed Identification Using Machine Learning

Model has been prepared so as to classify the two varieties of rice seed which humans generally intake as food; Jasmine and Gonen. Null values are absent in this dataset, directly exploratory data analysis has been conducted. Data is visualized through many techniques and gives the clear indication that how data is dependent and distributed through the various plots. After encoding the classes three models Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and most dedicated algorithm Neural Network are taken here. With the usage of hyperparameter technique it becomes comfortable to get the best fitted parameters to train the model and calculate the accuracy by various methods.
#### About Dataset

The data in the dataset was extracted from two kinds of rice (Gonen, Jasmine).
